# Node.js Asynchronous Operation Timeout Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Node.js applications involving asynchronous operations that can timeout before a response is received. The example showcases a scenario where a request might fail if the server takes longer to respond than the implicit timeout in the request library.

## Bug Description

The bug is related to asynchronous request handling, where a client makes a request to a server that simulates a long processing time.  If the processing time exceeds the default timeout of the client's request library, the request might fail before receiving the server's response.  This can lead to unexpected errors and incomplete data handling.  Debugging this type of error can be challenging due to its asynchronous nature.

## Solution

The solution addresses the timeout problem by explicitly setting a timeout value for the request using the `timeout` option in the `request` library.  This allows for more control over the request's behavior, preventing it from failing prematurely due to long processing times on the server side.
